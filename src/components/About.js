            After finishing my Graphic Design degree, I found a real interest in
            front-end developmentâ€”where design and logic meet. I enjoy building
            clean, useful interfaces and solving problems in ways that feel
            intuitive. There's nothing better than seeing something you made
            actually get used. Chasing that sense of real impact is what keeps
            me going.
